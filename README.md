# JavaScritpCalendar

Calendar which allows for signups and logins (through php scripts and information storage in mySQL). Calendar display is at the month level, and through AJAX requests (using jQuery), one is allowed to scroll through months, add or edit events, login, signup, or logout without the need to reload the page. 

Sessions are not destroyed upon page refresh but a user must explicitly sign out.
